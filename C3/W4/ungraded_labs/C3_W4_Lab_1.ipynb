    "\n",
    "For this week, you will look at techniques to prepare data and build models for text generation. You will train a neural network with lyrics from an Irish song then let it make a new song for you. Though this might sound like a more complex application, you'll soon see that the process is very similar to the ones you've been using in the previous weeks. Only minor modifications are needed. Let's see what these are in the next sections."

Basically, instead of getting the index with max probability, you will get the top three indices and choose one at random. See if the output text makes more sense with this approach. This is not the most time efficient solution because it is always sorting the entire array even if you only need the top three. Feel free to improve it and of course, you can also develop your own method of picking the next word."
